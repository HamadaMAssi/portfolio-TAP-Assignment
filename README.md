# Personal Portfolio Website

## Introduction
This repository contains my solution to the HTML/CSS and JavaScript questions. Below are the details for each task:

### HTML/CSS Question

#### Task
Create a personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS (one page) that showcases your skills and relevant information. The design and layout should follow the provided image, but with customized text and images to reflect your own information. The website should also be responsive.

#### Requirements

##### Design
- Follow the structure, layout, fonts, and colors of the provided image.
  
##### HTML Structure
- Use semantic HTML elements to structure the web page, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.
  
##### CSS Styling
- Use CSS to style the web page.
- Define colors using CSS variables: `#D1884F`, `#008AAA`, `#3BBADB`.
- Use the font "Poppins" ([Google Fonts - Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)).

##### Responsive Design
- Ensure the webpage is responsive and fits well on all screen sizes.

#### Submission Guidelines

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and upload your project files.
2. Deploy the website to GitHub pages.
3. Share the GitHub repository link for evaluation.

Note: Do not use pre-built templates or frameworks like Bootstrap, ReactJS, etc. Write the code from scratch to showcase your abilities.

### JavaScript Question

#### Task
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. The answer can be returned in any order.

#### Example
Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`  
Output: `[0, 1]`  
Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.
